# RISC32NetlsitToGDSII
Physical Design of RISC processor

This is readme file and it says that the description of Project is in the ProjectRISC.pdf file.
Schematic.png is a schematic view of gate level netlist.

This project is still going on and extennted to IR Drop analysis on RedHawk for final power sign-off.
Moreover, Physical verification will also be done after power analysis.
